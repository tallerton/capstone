# Capstone 25 - We Are Farmers

Our project's aims relate to the investigation into social networks and adoption of climate change mitigation measures (CCMM).

The goal of our project was to understand the extent to which the social network of farmers plays a role in their adoption of CCMM. 
‘Networks as theory are based on the fundamental premise that interconnectedness represents the mechanism of action.’ Perry, Pescosolido & Borgatti 2018. 
On the other hand, farmers are stereotypically portrayed as isolated, and self-contained. Thus, to what extent do farmers who are actively sharing advice with one another influence 
each other’s decisions to adopt CCMM? Furthermore, how does the composition of a farmer’s social network impact her propensity to adopt CCMM.

Drawing on social and egocentric network analysis, we engineered ego network features such as community membership and computed centrality measures such as closeness.
We adopted statistical approaches, such as ordinary least squares regression with percentage of relevant measures adopted as the dependent variable, to better understand any network effects.

Within this Github repository, you will find various python notebooks which are titled for the individual techniques and use cases they fulfill. Along with these are the raw data files, which are 
the csv files.
